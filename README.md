# [Jeebus' Friends Since Checker for Roblox (JFSC)](https://woahitsjeebus.github.io/JFSC/)

JFSC is a web application that allows Roblox users to check how long they have been friends with other users on the platform. It provides a simple interface to view and manage friendship durations. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the Roblox API to fetch friendship data.

Roblox does not track "Friends Since" dates. You may edit your friends' "Friends Since" dates manually via an "Edit" feature if you have a rough idea of when you added someone (checking old message dates, game history, Muneeb's Friend Checker game, Vencord's "Friends Since" plugin).

## Features
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and management of friendship data.
- View a list of your Roblox friends along with the duration of your friendship.
- Edit the "Friends Since" date for each friend to keep track of when you became friends.
- Export or import friendship data to a JSON file for easy backups, transfers, or sharing.
- Slick and responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
